		<span class="firstWord">I</span>t probably takes more than a day to completly take eveything in and even at the end of the day you would be
		longing for more time. Every year it attracts millions of visitors from all age groups and all walks of life. So plan your trip accordingly
		since it will be crowded mostof the time. Avoid public hoildays and show up early you would have a blast.

		I visited the miniature wonderland on 20th october 2012 and had a very good experience, here is my impression of the wonderland.....

        <span class="firstWord">N</span>early a 1000 trains runs several kilometers a day through the country side, through towns, through tunnels in mountains,
        over spectacular bridges. Also you can spot trains crossing the different sections under your feet in the floor, over your heads in the
        celing and through tunnels in the walls. <br /><br />

        The Airport is also a wonderful fleat of achivement where the taxi, take-off and landing of the miniature airplanes are simulated perfectly.
        In the oceans which contain gallons of water all manners of boats from fishing vessels to curisers roam freely.

	    <span class="firstWord">E</span>very nook and corner in the miniature universe hides a story and every passing train makes a history.
		There are several easter eggs hidden in the miniature wilderness only for the paitent visitor.  To make things more realistic the lighting
		across the exhibit simulates the day-night cycle every fifteen minutes. <br /><br />

		In short if you really admire and have a curiosity towards our world and it's workings, you will have a blast in the minature wonderland.
		And if you are a photographer you would find a ton of oppurtunties to epic photographs, so don't miss it.
