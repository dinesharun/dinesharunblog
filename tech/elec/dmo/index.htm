   Every electronics enthusiats will always love own an oscilloscope to analyze every circuits they encounter.
   But economical issues always prevents the possesion of such an cool toy. I was also longing for an oscilloscope for years,
   but unable to get my hands on one. So one day i decided i will build my own oscillscope, albeit a small one.
   The basic operation of an oscilloscope is simple, a horizontal/vertical sweep system and a comparator would do.
   I built a small prototype based on this theory. It is a 7x8 LED display with a range of 20 - 100 Hz.
   In details the circuit does the following operations,

<ul>
  <li> First a frequency generator based on a 555 timer generates the base frequency used all along the system. It determines the maximum frequency of the input wave
       that can be traced without aliasing. </li>
  <li> Then a stair case generator circuit generates a staircase signal, which is split into two to form a stair case window for comparision.
       These stair case signals are fed into the references end of two comparators based on OP AMP 741. </li>
  <li> The input goes straight to the comparators and the comparators output either TRUE or FALSE based of the input signals presence in between the
       comaprision window. </li>
  <li> In parallel there are vertical and horizontal sweep generator circuits that enable one row at a time in the 7*8 LED array </li>
  <li> The column LED is selected from the comparator output. So when a row and a coloumn is selected a LED glows. </li>
  <li> When this process is repeated several times a second the input wave appears in the LED array. </li>
</ul>
